As the world grapples with the challenges of food security, climate change, and sustainable farming practices, many hopes are placed on AI and robotics to overcome these challenges. Robotics and AI can play an important role in saving resources, automation, climate change adaptation and environmental protection. 

This workshop is intended to offer researchers from industry, start-ups and academia in this field the opportunity to present their research, exchange ideas and discuss open challenges on the following topics:

* Smart Implements
* Weeding Robotics
* Remote Sensing and Modelling e.g. for Crop Management
* Pest and Disease Detection
* Yield Prediction
* Harvesting Robotics
* AI and Robotics in Livestock
* Decision Support Systems
* Datasets
* Animal and Plant Phenotyping
